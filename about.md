Hello from the Harvard Art Museums and the Digital Infrastructure and Emerging Technology (DIET) and Digital Imaging and Visual Resources (DIVR) departments.

### Our Mission

DIET is here to do good things with interesting data. We are here to make sure the ones and zeros are flowing. We are here to make sure every datum has a happy life from beginning to end and does the most meaningful work for the institution. Through technology we make a great art collection accessible to the museums' staff, to everyone at Harvard, and to the world.

## Our API

The Harvard Art Museums API is a REST-style service designed for developers who wish to explore and integrate the museumsâ€™ collections in their projects. The API provides direct access to JSON formatted data that powers this website and many other aspects of the museums.

[Request a key](https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/api) for our api and build something!
