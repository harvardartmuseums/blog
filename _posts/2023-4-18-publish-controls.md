## New Publication Controls for Tour Builder Slides and Stops

Publication controls are now available for Stops and Slides. New Stops and Slides are “Published” by default but users can also set them to “Hidden.”

There is also a new control (in the form of a select input) for determining whether the preview shows “all items” or only those that are published.

This setting controls what shows up in the tour-preview link as well as what appears in the “live” preview on the right side of the Tour Builder view.

So if a user wants to create a new Stop or Slide that is not ready for publication, the user can set it to “Hidden” right after it is created. To make the preview available while the slide edit view is active, change the select menu on the left side to “Preview All Items.”

When hidden Stops or Slides are ready for publication, set the toggle for each item to “Published” and create a new snapshot.
